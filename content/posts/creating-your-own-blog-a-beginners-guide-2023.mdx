## Introduction

Not too long ago, a wild idea struck me – starting my very own blog, a technical one, or maybe not just technical.

The first challenge that confronted me was choosing the right engine to power my blog.
Let me be clear, I'm not a front-end expert, so don't expect to find advanced best practices here.
Instead, I'm going to share my journey of creating this very blog you are reading.
Surprisingly, it turned out to be a straightforward process, thanks to the `Next.js` and `Tailwind` and `ContentLayer` combo.
With just a minimal understanding of these technologies, you can effortlessly customize and style the defaults to suit your personal preferences.
So, without further ado, let's dive into the journey of building a personal blog!

## Starting Strong: An Excellent Template

When it came to setting up my blog, I chose not to reinvent the wheel and instead opted for a tried-and-true option – `Next.js` on Vercel.
While creating a new application in the Vercel console, I've found a [perfect template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-contentlayer) for my needs. This template relies on [ContentLayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev), which allow to easily edit posts as MDX files.
Coupled with Tailwind CSS, my personal favorite for crafting web app styles, the combination proved to be a powerful and efficient choice.

Moreover, Tailwind CSS grants access to a great `typography` [plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin), effectively eliminating any worries about styling my blog posts. By composing content in markdown and enclosing it with a class like `prose` within a div, the end result is a visually stunning layout that always impresses.

So after we followed those simple step in Vercel to create new app from the template, we will have:

1. A GitHub repository (which I recommend making public for the integration with `giscus` in the future)
2. A Vercel application (configured to build and deploy changes from the repository)
3. A fully operational blog website (the link is available in the Vercel console)

Even the initial generated blog has an attractive minimalistic design and could be used right away.

Now, let's explore how we can take this blog to the next level!

## Personalize Your Blog with `Tailwind CSS`

The beauty of Tailwind CSS lies in its simplicity and ease of use, even without extensive CSS knowledge. You have the creative freedom to design a layout that reflects your style and preferences. To get started, I added a personal info block at the top of each page. Take a look at the code snippet below:

```jsx showLineNumbers
import Image from "next/image";
import { GithubSocialIcon, LinkedIn } from "@/components/social-links";

export function AuthorInfo() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-row relative justify-between w-full mt-10 items-center">
      <div>
        <Image
          src={"/avatar.png"}
          alt="Andrey Fadeev photo"
          width={120}
          height={120}
          className="rounded-md"
        />
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col relative w-full ml-4">
        <h1 className="font-extrabold text-2xl tracking-tight">
          Andrey Fadeev
        </h1>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
          Staff Software Engineer at{" "}
          <a
            href={"https://kroo.com"}
            target={"_blank"}
            className={"underline-offset-[3px] hover:underline"}
          >
            Kroo Bank
          </a>
        </p>
        <div className={"mt-2 flex gap-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400"}>
          <LinkedIn />
          <GithubSocialIcon />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Similarly, you can create a simple footer for your blog:

```jsx showLineNumbers
import { GithubSocialIcon, LinkedIn } from "@/components/social-links";

export const Footer = () => {
  return (
    <footer className="flex justify-between container mx-auto py-2 text-gray-400 tracking-tight m-2">
      <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        © 2023{" "}
        <a
          className="hover:underline hover:text-black dark:hover:text-white underline-offset-[3px]"
          href="/"
        >
          Andrey Fadeev
        </a>
      </p>
      <ul className="flex items-center py-2 gap-2">
        <li>
          <LinkedIn />
        </li>
        <li>
          <GithubSocialIcon />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </footer>
  );
};
```

## Enhance Code Highlighting with `Prism.js`

The default template lacks a code highlighter for your code blocks. After trying out different options, I found that the `rehype-prism-plus` plugin, along with a visually appealing theme from `Prism.js`, worked best. This plugin allows you to enable features like code line numbers and line highlighting with minimal effort.

## Add a Comment Section with `Giscus`
I believe that having a comments section is crucial for any tech blog. After exploring various options, I found `giscus`, a fantastic open-source project. It utilizes GitHub's discussion feature as a backend for the comments section, and best of all, it's free to use. Visitors can easily log in using their GitHub accounts, making it perfect for a tech-focused blog.

Integrating `giscus` is straightforward, just follow the [instructions here](https://giscus.app/). In my code, I created a new component that also handles the theme switching:

```jsx
"use client";

import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
import Giscus from "@giscus/react";

export function GithubComments() {
  const { theme, systemTheme } = useTheme();
  const currentTheme = theme === "system" ? systemTheme : theme;

  return (
    <div className={"mt-2"}>
      <Giscus
        id="comments"
        repo="andfadeev/my-repo"
        repoId="***"
        category="Announcements"
        categoryId="***"
        mapping="url"
        reactionsEnabled="0"
        emitMetadata="0"
        inputPosition="bottom"
        theme={currentTheme}
        lang="en"
        loading="lazy"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Adding a "Buy Me a Coffee" Button
If you're looking to allow your visitors to support you, adding a "Buy Me a Coffee" button is a nice touch. You can integrate this widget into your blog and provide a link to your donation page. Simply [create an account](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) and set up your page.

To add the button, you have multiple options. You can use their generator for buttons or widgets, or simply copy the link to your page and style it as you wish. I used some beautiful `Tailwind CSS` [buttons with gradients](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/buttons/#gradient-duotone), and they look fabulous.

Here's the code for the "Buy Me a Coffee" button:

```jsx
"use client";

import { useTheme } from "next-themes";

export function DonateButton() {
  const { theme, systemTheme } = useTheme();
  const currentTheme = theme === "system" ? systemTheme : theme;

  const buttonClassName =
    currentTheme === "dark"
      ? "text-white bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 hover:bg-gradient-to-l focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-purple-200 dark:focus:ring-purple-800 font-medium rounded-md text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center"
      : "text-white bg-gradient-to-br from-pink-500 to-orange-400 hover:bg-gradient-to-bl focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-pink-200 dark:focus:ring-pink-800 font-medium rounded-md text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center";

  return (
    <a
      href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/andrey.fadeev"
      target="_blank"
      className={"block"}
    >
      <button className={buttonClassName}>Buy me a coffee</button>
    </a>
  );
}
```

## Ready for Your Own Domain?

The final touch, if you are taking this seriously, is to invest a few pounds in your own domain. It may not be the most expensive thing in the world, but your website will greatly benefit from it. Simply select a domain registrar, brainstorm a fantastic name, and make it yours! Integrating your domain with the website you deployed on Vercel is a breeze – just follow the instructions, typically involving configuring CNAME and A records.

## Google Analytics

Expect a significant surge in traffic and don't want to miss out on valuable insights? In that case, registering and attaching Google Analytics to your blog is a wise move.
