Recently, I embarked on a journey to start my own technical blog, and I want to share my experience with you. As a non-front-end developer and not an expert in the field, I'm not here to teach you best practices. Instead, I'll describe the simple steps I took to create the blog you're reading now. If you're interested in customizing and styling your blog, you'll need minimal knowledge of `Next.js` and `Tailwind`. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Choosing a Template
Rather than reinventing the wheel, I opted for a standard approach and decided to deploy with Vercel. When you create a new application in the Vercel console, you can select from a variety of templates. I chose this one: [link to template]. By doing so, I already had the following in place:
1. A GitHub repository configured to trigger builds on new commits
2. A Vercel application
3. A ready-to-use blog

## Step 2: Adding a Comments Section
I believe that having a comments section is crucial for any tech blog. After exploring various options, I found `giscus`, a fantastic open-source project. It utilizes GitHub's discussion feature as a backend for the comments section, and best of all, it's free to use. Visitors can easily log in using their GitHub accounts, making it perfect for a tech-focused blog.

Integrating `giscus` is straightforward. Just follow the instructions [here](https://giscus.app/). In my code, I created a new component that also handles the theme switch:

```js
"use client"

import { useTheme } from "next-themes"
import Giscus from "@giscus/react"

export function GithubComments() {
  const { theme, systemTheme } = useTheme()
  const currentTheme = theme === 'system' ? systemTheme : theme

  return (
    <Giscus
      id="comments"
      repo="andfadeev/andrey-fadeev-blog"
      repoId=""
      category="Announcements"
      categoryId=""
      mapping="url"
      reactionsEnabled="0"
      emitMetadata="0"
      inputPosition="bottom"
      theme={currentTheme}
      lang="en"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  )
}
```

## Step 3: Adding a "Buy Me a Coffee" Button
If you're looking to allow your visitors to support you, adding a "Buy Me a Coffee" button is a nice touch. You can integrate this widget into your blog and provide a link to your donation page. Simply create an account [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) and set up your page.

To add the button, you have multiple options. You can use their generator for buttons or widgets, or simply copy the link to your page and style it as you wish. I used some beautiful Tailwind buttons with gradients (link), and they look fabulous.

Here's the code for the "Buy Me a Coffee" button:

```js
"use client"

import { useTheme } from "next-themes"

export function DonateButton() {
  const { theme, systemTheme } = useTheme()
  const currentTheme = theme === 'system' ? systemTheme : theme

  const buttonClassName = currentTheme === 'dark'
    ? "text-white bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 hover:bg-gradient-to-l focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-purple-200 dark:focus:ring-purple-800 font-medium rounded-md text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center"
    : "text-white bg-gradient-to-br from-pink-500 to-orange-400 hover:bg-gradient-to-bl focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-pink-200 dark:focus:ring-pink-800 font-medium rounded-md text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center"

  return (
    <a
      href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/andrey.fadeev"
      target="_blank"
      className={'block'}
    >
      <button className={buttonClassName}>
        Buy me a coffee
      </button>
    </a>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've now set up your beautiful blog and are ready to fill it with amazing content. Remember, this process is not about being perfect or an expert in front-end development. It's about sharing your passion and knowledge with others. Enjoy the journey and have fun creating!
